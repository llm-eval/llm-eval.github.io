    You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thouroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

    Input: Here is a description of an arithmetic problem:
    The value of aae is 10.
    The value of aab is 10.
    The value of aaa is 8.
    aac gets its value by dividing the value of aaa by those of aab.
    The value of aad is 6.
    aaf gets its value by multiplying together the value of aad and aae.
    aag gets its value by multiplying together the value of aac and aaf.
    Compute the result of aag. If the solution cannot be calculated, answer 'N/A'. Ensure your result is within a relative precision of 0.0001 (or 0.01%) compared to the ground truth value. Ensure your final result begins with '<<<' and ends with '>>>', for example, if the answer is 1, your final result should be <<<1>>>.
